The Wio LTE is well suited for outdoor projects where the device can connect to the GPS satellites and provide a real-time location of the item it is attached to. The LTE provides a wide bandwidth which allows much faster interaction between the user and device. Some example projects could be a bicycle sharing service, tracking pets or livestock, locating a vehicle, or even keeping track of a child.
