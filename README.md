# TinyCLR Ports
This repository hosts ports of TinyCLR to many different devices and targets -- along with the TinyCLR OS reference implementation: the FEZ. For information on porting TinyCLR to your device or building a firmware for an existing port, see https://docs.ghielectronics.com/software/tinyclr/native/intro.html.

This port include some more board for STM32F7xx chip. For the moment it's not working on STM32F746xx mcu boards, but it is working on Nucleo-144 STM32F767 and Disco-F769.
